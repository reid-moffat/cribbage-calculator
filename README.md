# cribbage-calculator

I have been playing cribbage for years and learned plenty of tricks and strategies; but figuring out what cards to discard can still be quite difficult

There are many simple strategies that can be picked up and applied pretty quick (such as 'never start with a five'); but calculating the optimal discard card(s) is simply not feasible most of the time due to the shear amount of possbilities of drop combinations and starter cards

There are many online claculators that can find points in a given hand and maybe give tips, but more can be done. The goal of this project is to:
* Take a starting cribbage hand as input
* Calculate the average number of points obtained from each combination of card(s) dropped
* Advise the user on other strategies they should take into account beyond just average points

If you would like to test this calculator, run UserInterface.java in src/Main. This is still in development; I cannot guarentee the absense of bugs and it currently only calculates average points for each drop combination
