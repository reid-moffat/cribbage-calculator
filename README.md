# cribbage-calculator

I have been playing cribbage for years and learned plenty of tricks and strategies; but the hardest part of the game still is figuring out what cards to discard

There are many simple strategies that can be picked up and applied pretty quick (such as 'never start with a five'), but calculating the optimal discard card(s) is simply not feasible most of the time. In two player cribbage, you must discard 2 of your 6 cards and one card is flipped up as the starter card, leading to hundreds of possibilities and many possible point combinations within each hand

There are many calculators online that can find the points in a given hand and some that will even give advice on how to play, but I want to go beyond this and create a program that will:
* Take a starting cribbage hand as input
* Calculate the average number of points obtained from each combination of card(s) dropped
* Advise the user on other strategies they should take into account beyond just average points

This project is currently still in development. Once completed, I plan on creating a public website with a simple GUI
