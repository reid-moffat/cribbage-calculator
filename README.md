# cribbage-calculator

Cribbage is a game that is hard to pick up and practically impossible to master

There are many simple strategies that can be picked up and applied pretty quick (such as 'never start with a five'); but calculating the optimal discard card(s) is simply not feasible most of the time due to the sheer amount of possibilities of drop combinations and starter cards

There are many online calculators that can find points in a given hand and maybe give tips, but more can be done. The goal of this project is to:
* Take a starting cribbage hand as input
* Calculate the average number of points obtained from each combination of card(s) dropped
* Advise the user on other strategies they should take into account beyond just average points (not implemented yet)

If you would like to test this calculator, run UserInterface.java in src/Main. This is still in development; I cannot guarantee the absence of bugs
